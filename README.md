# useLESS

Disclaimer: This project has nothing to do with Less, so forgive me for the misnomer. I'm 
not clever and this was the best pun I could come up with for the project.

## Motivation

There are CSS authors out there who are incredibly talented. I am not one of them. I 
consider managing stylesheets to be a chore, largely due to unnecessary code that is 
difficult to manage. What if we could eliminate unused styles throughout the development 
process and continually update our stylesheets to reflect what's actually being used in our 
projects? For me, that's a resounding "hell yes!" and that's the goal of this project.

## Usage

I'm still deciding how the final product will be implemented. Stay tuned.
